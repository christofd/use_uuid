      <h1>UseUuid</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
UseUuid is a Rails plugin that facilitates part of making a rails
application distributed across multiple databases/machines. This plugin
gives Rails models a uuid attribute and a body attribute with a
user-specified number of accessor methods.
</p>
<p>
The uuid attribute is useful to identify objects across multiple databases,
regardless of when and where they were created. It allows multiple
processes to create and share the same object types even when operating on
different databases and machines. The uuid attribute coexists with the
normal rails &#8216;id&#8217; attribute, allowing local db optimizations if
necessary by preserving the efficiencies of InnoDB&#8217;s sequential
primary key based layout. This plugin overwrites obj.find so that the uuid
is used instead of &#8216;id&#8217; when retrieving objects. Also,
initialize is overwritten so &#8216;uuid&#8217; is set at object creation.
Otherwise both find and new work as normal.
</p>
<p>
The body attribute is a text blob with a user specified set of accessors.
This allows the developer to implement a schema-less model. Schema-less
models are useful when you have multiple databases with many rows and want
to change the schema. Changing the schema, particularly when it impacts an
index, can take a long time and impacts database performance. Its also a
hassle for the developer to migrate multiple databases. UseUuid allows the
developer to make a schema change in one place and have it impact all
processes and all databases. Obviously you must be sharing the schema
definitions across processes, and the processes will need to be restarted
for the change to take effect. Note that putting an attribute into body
means the normal database join tables and indexes will no longer work for
that attribute. In a distributed shared-nothing database environment,
particularly a sharded one, these don&#8217;t work anyway, so you must have
an alternate way of finding objects by attribute, such as table based
indexes or denormalization. See <a
href="http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql">bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql</a>
for a discussion of schema-less databases.

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install the uuidtools gem

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
  sudo gem install uuidtools
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Migrations/schemas must have a uuid column and and a body column specified
like the following. The uuid column is required. The body column is only
required if you are using schema less attributes. The uuid must be 32
characters. The dashes are stripped from the UUIDs as they have no
information value. The body may be any size you want.

<pre>
             create_table &quot;model_with_uuids&quot;, :force =&gt; true do |t|
               t.string   &quot;uuid&quot;,       :limit =&gt; 32
               t.string   &quot;url&quot;
               t.text     &quot;body&quot;,       :limit =&gt; 10.megabytes
               t.datetime &quot;created_at&quot;
               t.datetime &quot;updated_at&quot;
             end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Install the use_uuid plugin. Schema definitions and probably some model
code will have to be shared between processes.

</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>UUID support</h4>
<p>
To specify which models will use_uuid:
</p>
<pre>
        class ModelWithUuid &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
          use_uuid
          has_many :other_models  # uuid will be used as the primary key instead of 'id' for all associations
        end

  m = ModelWithUuid.new :url =&gt; 'example.com'
  m.uuid                                        #=&gt; '011784fe143911de8948001aa018681c'
  m.url                                         #=&gt; 'example.com'
  m.save!

  # find() now uses the uuid column to ensure portability across databases
  ModelWithUuid.find('011784fe143911de8948001aa018681c') #=&gt; returns the object just saved.
  ModelWithUuid.find(1)                                  #=&gt; raises StandardError
  ModelWithUuid.find_by_id(1)                            #=&gt; returns the row saved earlier.
</pre>
<h4>Schema less attributes support</h4>
<p>
To specify which models will use_uuid:
</p>
<pre>
  class ModelWithUuid &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
          use_uuid :schema_less_attrs =&gt; [:entries, :likes]

  end
</pre>
<p>
The hash following use_uuid is optional. If omitted, use_uuid will only add
UUIDs to your model. If you specify an array of symbols, the symbols will
become keys to a hash that is stored in the body column. The hash is
serialized into the body column. The attributes may be accessed and set
like normal rails model attributes, for instance:
</p>
<pre>
  user = User.new
  user.entries = ['happy', 'not happy']
  user.save!  # serialized into body

  user = User.find(:all).first
  user.entries #=&gt; ['happy', 'not happy']  # retrieved from body
</pre>
<h4>Code Organization</h4>
<p>
If you need Uuids you probably have a distributed environment and/or have
multiple ruby programs/code bases that need to use the same schema
definitions. Putting &#8216;use_uuid&#8217; into the same models in each
code base is not DRY, so put them into the shared code base instead, then
include the shared code base into each model. One way to do that is to put
your shared model code (for instance, associations and shared methods) into
plugin form. Then create a plugin directory that is symlinked under lib/
from each project so all projects share the same plugins and thus all
models share the same schema and associations.
</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
Use_uuid has been tested with Rails 2.2.2 and Ruby 1.8.7. Compatibility
with other versions is unknown.
</p>
<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
<p>
UseUuid uses rails&#8217; &#8216;set_primary_key&#8217; to change the
primary key for the model from &#8216;id&#8217; to &#8216;uuid&#8217;. This
does not affect migrations or schemas, so they will continue to make
&#8216;id&#8217; the default auto incrementing integer primary key column
in the database. Since the &#8216;id&#8217; column will be different on
different databases for the same object, we can&#8217;t use it for finding
objects, but it may be used if you want to perform local optimizations. If
you&#8217;re using MySQL/InnoDB, you don&#8217;t want the uuid column to be
the database primary key, because InnoDB performs writes on disk based on
primary key, and since uuids are non sequential, you&#8217;ll be writing
disk non-sequentially, which is slow. For this reason UseUuid doesn&#8217;t
interfere with or rename the &#8216;id&#8217; column.
</p>
<p>
Its probably a good idea to index the uuid column in models that use_uuid.
